Using of cached values avoids object allocation and the code will be faster. Values between -128 and 127 are guaranteed to have corresponding cached instances and using valueOf is approximately 3.5 times faster than using constructor. For values outside the constant range the performance of both styles is the same. Unless the class must be compatible with JVMs predating Java 1.5, use either autoboxing or the valueOf() method when creating instances of Long, Integer, Short, Character, and Byte."},"de.upb.gpa.Checkstyle.12":{"startLine":"268","shortMessage":"'{' at column 2 should be on the previous line.","longMessage":"'{' at column 2 should be on the previous line."},"de.upb.gpa.Checkstyle.35":{"startLine":"261","shortMessage":"Parameter s should be final.","longMessage":"Parameter s should be final."},"de.upb.gpa.Checkstyle.13":{"startLine":"110","shortMessage":"'{' at column 3 should be on the previous line.","longMessage":"'{' at column 3 should be on the previous line."},"de.upb.gpa.Checkstyle.15":{"startLine":"262","shortMessage":"'{' at column 5 should be on the previous line.","longMessage":"'{' at column 5 should be on the previous line."},"de.upb.gpa.findbugs.HE_INHERITS_EQUALS_USE_HASHCODE":{"startLine":"54","shortMessage":"Bad practice - Class inherits equals() and uses Object.hashCode()","longMessage":"This class inherits equals(Object) from an abstract superclass, and hashCode() fromjava.lang.Object (which returns the identity hash code, an arbitrary value assigned to the object by the VM).&nbsp; Therefore, the class is very likely to violate the invariant that equal objects must have equal hashcodes.
