In general, if a method opens a stream or other resource, the method should use a try\/finally block to ensure that the stream or resource is cleaned up before the method returns. This bug pattern is essentially the same as the OS_OPEN_STREAM and ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCE bug patterns, but is based on a different (and hopefully better) static analysis technique.

For sending feedback, check: contributing guideline malinglist In particular, the false-positive suppression heuristics for this bug pattern have not been extensively tuned, so reports about false positives are helpful to us.
